# flaME

To use this program:
  download and extract the zip,

  open the data folder and extract the two zips,

  back out of the data folder and go to FlaMe/bin/Debug and run the exe,

  point FlaMe at the folders you unzipped in data and Flame should load as normal


This version of FlaMe uses json files as they appear in the game!



Unfortunately I couldn't get FlaMe to properly load version 4 pie files...

There were also several OutOfMemory exceptions when loading the new textures the game is using...

But the old models and textures still work so that's what I shipped
