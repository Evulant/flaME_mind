# Trouble shooting

Windows Defender Wacatac.B!ml False Positive:

      Windows Defender seems to think the executables in this repo are Trojan Horse Viruses of a specific
      
      variety that commonly hides in "Homebrew" and "Cracked" video games

      Don't run anything you don't think is safe and if you don't know if it's safe you can use a number
      
      of online tools such as VirusTotal.com to check

Errors and Exceptions from FlaMe:

      I try my best to keep the error log clean aside from normal and informative error messages.

      If you can't understand why a certain error is happening please screen shot the error message and

      provide the files Flame is loading

      this includes the folders with the tilesets and object data as well as the map file

      When sending maps make sure you send the folder with the map data as well if applicable to the map format

      ( For example, when loading cam1a.gam files are loaded from a folder called cam1a located in the same folder

      as cam1a.gam)

      I can be found on Discord as Mindstormsman
